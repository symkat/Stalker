Stalker is an irssi plugin to record information on an IRC network and draw correlations between peopleâ€™s current nicknames and nicknames they may have used in the past.

Some possible uses:

-	You have built a time machine and went back to 1995 and are currently being stalked by someone on IRC.  You DCC with the person and realize their IP is on the 192.168.0.0/24 CIDR.
-	Someone is evading your ban and your ban-hammer is twitching.
