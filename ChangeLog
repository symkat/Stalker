    * Fixed the default stalker_guest_nick_regex setting; should be a pattern 
	and not include the /'s. Patch by VinzNL.

2011-09-11 .70
    * Changed add_record to do asynchronous DB access. This adds a pidwait trap,
	and functions record_added, async_add and db_add_record (which does what 
	add_record used to do). This prevents the script from locking up irssi when
	there are a lot of records to add, eg when joining a large channel or when
	connecting to a network. The forking code was stolen from Timo 'cras' 
	Sirainen (http://scripts.irssi.org/html/dns.pl). Been working for me for 6
	months so I hope it's solid code.

2011-09-10 .60
    * Added add_timestamp_column. This adds a "added" timestamp column to the
	database which records when a record was added.

    * Added stalker_stalk_on_join option.  Turning this on will show previous
    nicknames when a user joins "foo foo@bar has joined #perl ( foo, bar, blee
    )"
    Thanks to an anonymous submitter for the patch and suggestion.

2010-10-06

      stalker.pl outside of ~/
