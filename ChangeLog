	* Add database indices to speed up read accesses.

2011-09-15 .74
    * Merged in the testing branch to get two DB handles to avoid the parent
      and child process from conflicting by using the same handle.
        - IsaacG

2011-08-12 .73
    * Sort nicknames show in case-insensitive alphabetical order by VinzNL.
        - IsaacG

2011-08-12 .72
    * Added _ignore_guest_hosts and _guest_host_regex. Allows you to ignore a
      host, such as "webchat", "mibbit" or "gmail.com" (for Bitlbee users).
      Code by VinzNL.

2011-08-12 .71
    * Fixed the default stalker_guest_nick_regex setting; should be a pattern 
      and not include the /'s. Patch by VinzNL.

2011-08-11 .70
    * Changed add_record to do asynchronous DB access. This adds a pidwait trap,
      and functions record_added, async_add and db_add_record (which does what 
      add_record used to do). This prevents the script from locking up irssi when
      there are a lot of records to add, eg when joining a large channel or when
      connecting to a network. The forking code was stolen from Timo 'cras' 
      Sirainen (http://scripts.irssi.org/html/dns.pl). Been working for me for 6
      months so I hope it's solid code.

2011-08-12 .62
    * Added stalker_normalize_nick option, default on.
      When set, nicknames which contain any of '-_~^`' will not
      be shown if a version without those exist.  For example
      results like "symkat`, symkat, sym`kat" will just be "symkat",
      while results like "`foo bar bar`" would be "`foo bar".
      When turned off, acts as before, listing all nicknames.
      Inspired by VinzNL's branch on GitHub.
        - SymKat

2011-08-10 .60
    * Added add_timestamp_column. This adds a "added" timestamp column to the
      database which records when a record was added.
        - IsaacG

2011-01-16 .50
    * Added stalker_stalk_on_join option.  Turning this on will show previous
    nicknames when a user joins "foo foo@bar has joined #perl ( foo, bar, blee
    )"
    Thanks to an anonymous submitter for the patch and suggestion.

2010-10-09
    * Added channel sync event handling to replace who on join
    * Removed hide_who option (no longer needed)
    * Thanks to Wouter Coekaerts for the suggestion!
2010-10-06
    * Added patch by Mantas Mikulėnas "Make the default paths relative 
      to Irssi home directory" to correct issue with paths when starting
      stalker.pl outside of ~/

2010-10-06
